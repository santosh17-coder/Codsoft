This repository contains several machine learning projects focused on different domains,
including classification and regression tasks. Each project applies specific models and evaluation techniques to address unique datasets and objectives.

Projects Overview
Each project in this repository addresses a different machine learning task using various techniques and models. From classification tasks (Iris and Titanic Survival) to regression tasks (Sales Prediction and XGBoost Regression), these projects showcase model development, feature engineering, and evaluation processes.

Project Descriptions
Iris Classification
This project classifies iris flowers into species based on sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width. It uses classification algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, and Support Vector Machines (SVM) to predict the flower species.

Dataset: The classic Iris dataset, available from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.
Objective: Predict the species of an iris flower based on its attributes.
Evaluation Metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall.
Sales Prediction
The goal of the Sales Prediction project is to predict product sales based on historical sales data and various features. It applies linear regression and other regression models to forecast sales figures.

Dataset: A historical sales dataset with features such as product type, store location, and seasonality.
Objective: Predict future sales volumes for products.
Evaluation Metrics: Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), R-squared.
Titanic Survival Prediction
This project predicts the likelihood of passenger survival based on various attributes, such as age, gender, and class. Using classification models, it determines survival probabilities.

Dataset: Titanic dataset from Kaggle.
Objective: Predict if a passenger would survive the Titanic disaster based on their features.
Evaluation Metrics: Accuracy, F1 Score, ROC-AUC.
XGBoost Regression
In this project, we implement the XGBoost algorithm to predict continuous target variables using gradient boosting on decision trees. It focuses on feature engineering and hyperparameter tuning to optimize model performance.

Dataset: (Specify dataset if available).
Objective: Perform regression tasks with high accuracy.
Evaluation Metrics: MAE, RMSE, R-squared.
Technologies Used
Python: Programming language used for data processing and model building
Pandas: For data manipulation
Scikit-Learn: Machine learning library for model development and evaluation
XGBoost: Extreme Gradient Boosting library, optimized for regression and classification
Jupyter Notebook: For code organization and presentation
